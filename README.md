# '"Rosalind Solutions"'

These are my current solutions to the Rosalind Problems.  I am very fond of the Biopython toolset and try to apply it where appropriate.  As such, implementation of many of these solutions require its' installation.  I have tried to annotate my code and notify where installations may be necessary.  I generally work with Python 2.7 however I will work towards Python 3.X functionality.  I would like to create solutions with other programming languages but primarily these will consist of only python solutions.
